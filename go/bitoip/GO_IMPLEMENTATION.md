# bitoip: golang implementation

## Basics
This is the go implementation of the protocol messages and a UDP receiver and transmitter
which include marshalling and unmarshalling of messages.

## To be fixed later
The transmission of carrier messages is at their full size. These ought to be 
variable length on the wire.  This should be fixed in a backward-compatible kind of way.
