## Terms of use

# Introduction
By using the cwc-station software, you will be providing data to a reflector and to other CWC stations.
This explains how the data is distributed and used.  By using this software, you agree to this *public* distribution.

## Using cwc-station
When you use CWC-Station, your callsign and external IP address, last poll time and last transmit time
are publicly provided on the reflector's channel page. This allows other users to find you
and see when you are active.  This data is publicly provided on the internet and not protected in any way.   

If you do not want your callsign to be publicly associated with your listening or transmission,
do not enter you callsign in the cwc-station config or do not use cwc-station.

It is possible your external IP address will give a good indication of your general location.
Do not use cwc-station if you don't wish this to become public.

And morse transmissions you make can be received by anybody running cwc-station.

## cwc-reflector data use
1. cwc-reflector may collate your activity data (including transmit and connection times) for use in statics and graphs.  This may be linked
to your callsign
1. cwc-reflector may use your transmissions as training data for AI bots, and to collate word lists
for cwc-training.  This will not be linked to your callsign.
